        "FileSummary": "The user messages relate to a Spring 2025 Bachelor's theses orientation session and related guidelines for junior graduate students at the German University in Cairo (GUC), specifically within the Faculty of Media Engineering and Technology. Key aspects covered include: thesis format, assessment and grading criteria, weekly meeting requirements and deliverables (minutes, presentations, reports, etc.), the importance of using block diagrams for planning and visualizing the implementation, a timeline with deadlines (e.g., August 2025 for Round I, March and April 2025 for reports), and the use of the GUC thesis template. The documents mention required elements of a good presentation (title, introduction, conclusion, etc.) and good research practices. The use of tools like Python, Java, Matlab, Mathematica, and Overleaf are suggested. A three-pass method for research paper reading is recommended to get in-depth paper understanding. There is also a named list of students, including their thesis topics and supervisors."
